# Dataset Discription

Its Sales Dataset contains sales transaction records of a retail store. It includes demographic details of customers and information about the products they purchased. This dataset is useful for customer segmentation, sales trend analysis, and marketing strategy insights.

## Analysis Goal
a. Data Overview

Use .describe() for statistical summary.

Use .info() to understand data types and missing values.

Use .value_counts() on categorical columns to understand distribution.

b. Visualization

Use sns.pairplot() to observe relationships between numerical features.

Use sns.heatmap() to show correlations.

Use histograms to check data distribution (e.g., purchase amount).

Use boxplots to observe outliers and category-wise spread.

Use scatterplots to analyze trends between features (e.g., Age vs. Purchase).

c. Trends & Relationships

Identify if age, occupation, or city type impacts purchasing power.

Check if marital status influences spending habits.

Understand which product categories are most popular.

Explore purchase behavior by gender.

d. Observation Notes Each visual should be accompanied by:

A short interpretation (e.g., “Males tend to spend slightly more than females”).

Any patterns spotted (e.g., “People aged 26–35 make the highest purchases”).

e. Summary of Findings

Highlight key insights (e.g., “City Category B has the highest sales”, or “Product Category 1 is the most purchased”).

Mention any business recommendations (e.g., “Focus marketing campaigns on married males in age group 26–35”).
